# Basuwara – Educational Mobile Application

## Project Overview
Basuwara is an educational mobile application designed to promote the learning and preservation of traditional Indonesian scripts. The application aims to bridge the gap between the modern digital era and Indonesia’s linguistic heritage by providing an engaging and accessible learning experience for everyone.

This project was part of my learning experience in collaborative Android development during the Bangkit Academy program.
